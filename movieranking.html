<h1>THE BEST MOVIES I SAW</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies favorites of all-time.</h2>

<hr />
<h3>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>

<p>
  Like the work of a young artist who refuses to be restrained by the borders of
  the frame, “Across the Spider-Verse” is loaded with incredible imagery and
  fascinating ideas.
</p>

<h3>Victim/Suspect</h3>
<p>
  “Victim/Suspect” has a guiding light for truth in the form of rising
  journalist Rachel de Leon, who works at the Center for Investigative
  Reporting.
</p>
<h3>Fast X</h3>
<p>
  a film that brazenly plays like a Greatest Hits collection from a hit artist.
